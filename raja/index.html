            <h2>
              I know the distance between us isn‚Äôt easy, but every time we talk,
              it feels like the world becomes smaller and nothing is too far
              away. The distance might change a lot of things, but one thing is
              for sure‚Äîmy heart is always with you, no matter how far apart we
              are.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              Sometimes, I find myself wishing I could be right there next to
              you, sharing all the good and tough moments together. But I always
              keep in mind that moment when we finally meet, when we overcome
              all these challenges and be together. I imagine all the things
              we‚Äôll do‚Äîlike sitting in a quiet place, talking about everything
              we‚Äôve been through, and laughing at all the little things we see
              in our everyday lives.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              The distance doesn‚Äôt change what we have; if anything, it makes
              our love stronger. Every time we talk or see each other on a video
              call, I feel closer to you and understand you even more. Not a day
              goes by without me thinking about you, hoping you‚Äôre happy and
              doing well.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              What gives me hope the most is knowing that despite this distance,
              we‚Äôre still here for each other, holding on through everything.
              The distance won‚Äôt last forever, and one day we‚Äôll be together,
              remembering all these moments as beautiful memories.
            </h2>

            <h2>
              I love you from here to the sky, and no matter the circumstances,
              I‚Äôm here for you, and I‚Äôll always be¬†by¬†your¬†side.
